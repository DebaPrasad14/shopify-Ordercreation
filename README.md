##shopify-Ordercreation
This app is created to get notified when a customer places order from my created test store.

This application is done using webhooks present in shopify.

This is designed to store details of an order when a customer places an order from my teststore present in shopify..
After payment done using bogus payment gateway storeowner(here me) will get all information related to the order ..

Then this application stores these order details in database and, store owner can see how many orders have been placed from his store.

And also store owner can edit/modify the email and phone which is present in databse corresponding to the customer.

This app is hosted in heroku. It is available in below link. -

To get above behaviour, one has to place order from my teststore present in shopify.com, do payment and after that the order details will show in this link.
you can also edit/modify phone/email.
